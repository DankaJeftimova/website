You can learn more about this on the Competitions page. Always a neat and responsible student, I maintained a perfect GPA of 5.0 at the end of every school year.

I explored complex mathematical subfields and learned new programming languages such as C++ and Python, starting from beginner level and progressing to more advanced topics like object-oriented programming. I also learned markup languages like HTML and CSS. Once again, with the support of my teachers and classmates, I excelled in national competitions, proudly representing my school. Since this high school is located in Skopje and I donâ€™t live there, I moved into a state dormitory for high school students. You can read more about that below.')

Dorm life is something unforgettable, and something I wish everyone could experience.')
